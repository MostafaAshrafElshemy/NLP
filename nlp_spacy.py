enma_ja="from the National Day Laborer Organizing Network stepped in, pressing local officials to call the field director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to voice their concerns and asking activists to do the same. ICE officials said that Mr. Avelica would have been a target under the Obama administration because of his conviction and order of removal. Officers abided by the agencyâ€™s sensitive locations policy, which generally restricts arrests in schools, and stopped him about half a mile from the school, not knowing that one of the daughters remained in the car, the officials said. Since receiving his deportation order, Mr. Avelica has occasionally talked with his children about the possibility that he could be sent back to Mexico. He worked for years in restaurants,   shifts, six days a week, his family said. He tried to avoid any contact with law enforcement officials. His two adult daughters warned their younger sisters two weeks ago that he could be in danger, but they cut the conversation short before making any specific plans. Jeff Gorell, the Los Angeles deputy mayor for public safety, said the circumstances of Mr. Avelicaâ€™s arrest were concerning enough that he wanted more information. â€œThereâ€™s certainly heightened focus here on the activities of ICE,â€ he said. â€œAny incident that affects our neighborhoods with the kind of response that a detention gets of course gives the mayor concern. Thatâ€™s one of the reasons we called immediately. â€ Pablo Alvarado, the executive director of the day labor organization, said the involvement from local officials probably helped keep Mr. Avelica in the country for now. He is being held at a detention center about two hours east of Los Angeles. â€œPolitical leaders are trying to understand whatâ€™s rhetoric and whatâ€™s real, but I think they are starting to see that weâ€™re not just talking about hypothetical,â€ Mr. Alvarado said. â€œThere are going to be real dilemmas for elected officials about how complicit they are willing to be. â€"
