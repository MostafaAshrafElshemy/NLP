Welcome to the NLP wiki!

NLP can refer to different things depending on the context. Here are two common meanings:

Natural Language Processing (NLP): This is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and contextually relevant. Applications of NLP include language translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and text summarization.

Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP): This is an approach to communication, personal development, and psychotherapy. It is based on the premise that there is a connection between neurological processes, language, and behavioral patterns that have been learned through experience. NLP posits that these can be changed to achieve specific goals in life. It is often used in self-help and therapeutic contexts.
